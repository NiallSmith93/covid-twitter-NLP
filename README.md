# covid-twitter-NLP
This project entails collecting and analysing recent tweets related to the currently unfolding coronavirus pandemic.

The main objectives of this project are to:
- Familiarise with the basics of text analysis and NLP techniques
- Use a twitter developer account to access and work with live twitter data via the API
- Gain some insights into tweets being published on a current and interesting topic, in this case the COVID-19 pandemic

Inspiration and guidance was gained in part from various helpful resources including by DataCamp, Earth Lab at UC Boulder and towardsdatascience via Medium
